Unit grouping algorithm
-----------------------
- Start with one unit
- Is another unit close enough for the two to be in a group?
- If so, make a group; calculate center of mass; increase 'close enough' value
    - For each unit, ask whether they're close enough to center of mass
    - if so, add the unit and recaculculate center of mass
- can do this in multiple passes, and can create multiple groups at once
- both useful for detecting enemy groups and potentially for own units
    - are my units that are supposed to be in a group not close enough together?


-------------------
Concaving algorithm
-------------------
- use enemy group center of mass as center of a large circle to
    try to place units around before & while attacking


------------------
Remove Stale Units
------------------
- A queue which always has an open slot to the back container to store newly missing units
- containers move toward front of queue over time.
- when container reaches the front, units are forgotten.

Creating Discord In the Enemy Army
----------------------------------
- Strategic map positioning:
    - Establish linking paths between enemy bases and between main
    production and army (if army on map),
    which are routes of safe transport for enemy units.
    - Try to break the links, making them unsafe, by establishing presences along
    those routes.
