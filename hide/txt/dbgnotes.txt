- assigning structures to bases (ZvZ):
    - lair -> hive counts new structure
    - same for hatch -> lair
    - made an extractor, turned into base as expected
        - canceled extractor out of vision, base remained
        - (because onDestroy() is only called for 
        visible/detected(?) units)
    - killing structures INCREMENTED base counter:
        - extractor

- some enemy drones going in and out of vision while mining are being unassigned from base
- they might actually be getting cleared from unitstorage
