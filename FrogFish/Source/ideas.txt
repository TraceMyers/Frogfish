Unit grouping algorithm
-----------------------
- Start with one unit
- Is another unit close enough for the two to be in a group?
- If so, make a group; calculate center of mass; increase 'close enough' value
    - For each unit, ask whether they're close enough to center of mass
    - if so, add the unit and recaculculate center of mass
- can do this in multiple passes, and can create multiple groups at once
- both useful for detecting enemy groups and potentially for own units
    - are my units that are supposed to be in a group not close enough together?
