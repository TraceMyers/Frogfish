- assigning structures to bases (ZvZ):
    - lair -> hive counts new structure
    - same for hatch -> lair
    - made an extractor, turned into base as expected
        - canceled extractor out of vision, base remained
        - (because onDestroy() is only called for 
        visible/detected(?) units)
    - killing structures INCREMENTED base counter:
        - extractor
